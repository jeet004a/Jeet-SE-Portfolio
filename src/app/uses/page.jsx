      description: `Upgraded from my trusty MSI Laptop and oh boy, what a glow-up! 
This M4 beast is like going from a bicycle to a rocket ship 🚀. Though I occasionally make it break a sweat with my tab-hoarding tendencies (what's one more ChatGPT tab, right?).

Still blows my mind how Apple managed to pack a supercomputer into something thinner than most books.

This machine is a beast. I use this for all the heavy lifting I need to do for all my personal and professional pursuits.`,

      title: "BenQ PD3225U Pro-design Monitor",
      tag: "Personal",
      description: `This 32" 4K almost bezel-less monitor was a rare find.
The fact that it also acts as a hub and charges all my devices is super convenient.

Also the color accuracy is amazing. It has served me very well for my development and gaming needs.
It also supports daisy chaining, so I can very easily connect another BenQ monitor in the future if needed.`,

      title: "Logitech MX Master 3 Mouse",
      tag: "Personal",

      title: "iPhone 13 Pro 256GB",
      tag: "Personal",
      description: `A man needs a man's phone, and this is mine.
Camera is great, battery life is great, and the display is great.
iPhones have served me very well every since I switched from Android in 2018.`,

            optimize my life for the things I enjoy doing. Here's a list of my
